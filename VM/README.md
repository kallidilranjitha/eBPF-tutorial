1. Installation of Hypervisor
   
   First install virtualbox(or an equivalent hypervisor) on the host system. Download the binary from the links below according to your host OS:

   Windows: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 

   Linux: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads 

   The installation should be straightforward. You can just stick with the default settings. 

2. Download the VM image.
3. Import the downloaded VM image.
   You can navigate to the installed location and double-click on the .ova file you downloaded. The screen below would be visible. Double-click on the Name and rename the VM if you wish to. For the rest of the guide, the VM has been renamed to “ebpf-tutorial”.

   On a Windows host machine, click Finish and wait for the process to complete. On an Ubuntu host, click on Import and wait for the process to complete.
